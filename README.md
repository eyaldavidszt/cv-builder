First time using react, did this CV builder thingy where you can input data and it generates HTML with the corresponding data, auto-updating. With the ability to remove/edit fields.

I could add a Work experience form but I think it would be exactly like implementing the Education form with just more inputs so I decided to pass on it.

In the future: Could (obviously) add a LOT of styling, add Work Experience, add jsPDF library to save cv as .pdf
